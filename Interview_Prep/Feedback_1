1. Vibe was not as If you weree really involved in project work, seemed a little mugged up while explaining past work.

2. Time complexity 2^h, but usually in this case height will not be a correct representation
		- 2^n

Solution Code started 5:27


 4. You should consider trivial edge cases, like root=null

5. Approach towards solution is a bit jumbled, which was leading to miss on few checks and logical error in code, â€¨ - Pro point here is firm hold on dry runs, that helped to catch errors
        - But it worked as a retrospective step
        - More coding practice is needed

6. Was actively listening  and responding on hints
